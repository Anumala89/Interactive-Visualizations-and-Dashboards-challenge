# Interactive-Visualizations-and-Dashboards-challenge

Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.


### Plotly

A horizontal bar chart was created from the data in samples.json that displays the top 10 OTUs found in an individual. Along with it, a bubble chart was also created that displays samples of OTUs found in the human navels. 


Bar Chart:

Sample_values as the values.

Otu_ids as the labels.

Otu_labels as the hovertext.


Bubble Chart:

Otu_ids as the x values.

Sample_values as the y values.

Sample_values as the marker size.

Otu_ids as the marker colors.

Otu_labels as the text values.



Demographic information of each individual is displayed in a box  which was created using bootstrap panel. Bar charts, bubble charts and demographic information of each individual will be displayed by selecting the 'Test Subject ID No.' from the dropdown menu.

Here is an example of Test Subject ID No. 946
